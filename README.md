Impossible Speed Clock by Jinwon

It is a active recursive drawing of 3 circle
in one circle

Each of 3 circle's moving speed means time.

The biggest outer circle's speed is current
second,
The middle circle's speed is current minute.
The smallest inner circle's speed is current
hour.

When hour>12, the inner circle changes
rotation direction, from c-clockwise to clockwise

So, when second is 1, outer circle moves very slow.
When it is 59, it moves very fast, and stops at 0.
Same with other 3 circles.

When hour>12 the inner circle changes
rotation direction, from c-clockwise to clockwise to show its p.m.
